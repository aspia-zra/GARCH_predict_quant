    "Parallel Processing: Unlike LSTMs, which process data step-by-step, transformers can process all data at once, speeding up training and inference, especially with large datasets.\n",

    "Attention Mechanism: Transformers use attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, which can help the model identify important events or patterns in stock data that are more impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Transformers tend to scale better with larger datasets, so as you collect more stock data, the transformer might improve more easily compared to LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "You're right! LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) were specifically designed to combat the vanishing gradient problem that occurs in traditional RNNs. They use special gating mechanisms to better retain long-term dependencies, which is why they're better at handling longer sequences than regular RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while LSTMs are much better than RNNs at retaining information over time, they can still struggle with very long sequences or data with complex patterns, like stock prices, especially when the sequence length becomes very large. This is because LSTMs still process data sequentially, and as the sequence grows, training can become slower and more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers, on the other hand, use a mechanism called self-attention, which allows them to look at all parts of the input at once. This means they can capture long-range dependencies more effectively and more efficiently, especially in very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even though LSTMs don’t have the same vanishing gradient issue as RNNs, transformers can still outperform them in tasks involving long-term dependencies and complex patterns."
